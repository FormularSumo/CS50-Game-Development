# CS50-Game-Development
My projects for the CS50 Game Development course - https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50G+Games/course/.
Games are coded in Lua and made with the LÖVE 2D game engine - https://love2d.org/.
To start a game install LÖVE 2D and drag the game folder onto love.exe. Or install a LÖVE 2D extension in your code editor, open main.lua and click Alt + L.
Games are designed to be played on a 1080 * 1920 monitor, however will try to scale to whatever resolution you run the window at.
