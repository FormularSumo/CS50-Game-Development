# CS50-Game-Development
Created in Lua with LÖVE 2D game engine.
To start a game install LÖVE 2D and drag the game folder onto love.exe. Pong.Ink is a shortcut on my system to do this but probably won't work on yours.
Games are designed to be played on a 1080 * 1920 monitor, however will try to scale to whatever resolution you run run the window at.

Differences from original:
Renders at window resolution rather than virtual resolution.
Scales based on window size.
Ball is a circle
First to 5 wins
F11 toggles fullscreen, escape exits fullscreen.
F5 resets game.
Space plays/pauses.
Text in centre of screen.
Font is default rather than retro.
